# Decentralized Library DApp

The **Decentralized Library** DApp allows users to manage and access books in a decentralized way. Users can upload, retrieve, and manage book records securely on the Aptos blockchain. The back-end logic is built with **Move** smart contracts, while the front-end is powered by **TypeScript**.

## Features
- **Add Books**: Users can upload book details to the blockchain.
- **Search Books**: Retrieve information about books stored on-chain.
- **Decentralized Storage**: All book records are securely stored on the Aptos blockchain.
- **Move Smart Contracts**: Ensure secure and immutable storage of book data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean UI for easy interaction with the decentralized library.

## Technologies Used
- **Move Language**: Handles storage and retrieval of book information on the blockchain.
- **Aptos Blockchain**: Provides a secure and decentralized system for storing books.
- **TypeScript**: Used for building the interactive front-end.

## How It Works
1. **Add a Book**: Users can input book details (title, author, etc.) and add it to the blockchain.
2. **Retrieve Books**: Users can search for books using keywords.
3. **Blockchain Storage**: All book data is recorded on-chain, ensuring data integrity and decentralized access.

## Prerequisites
- **Aptos CLI**: For deploying and interacting with the smart contracts.
- **Move SDK**: Used for developing and publishing the smart contracts.
- **Node.js & npm**: For running the TypeScript-based front-end.
